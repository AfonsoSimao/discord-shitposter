		<synopsis>Equipped with cutting-edge weaponry and specialized troops, a private military organization named Mithril strives to extinguish the world&amp;#039;s terrorism and all threats to peace on earth. The organization is powered by the &amp;quot;Whispered,&amp;quot; individuals who possess intuitive knowledge and the remarkable ability to create powerful devices and machinery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seventeen-year-old Sousuke Sagara, a sergeant working for Mithril, has been assigned to protect Kaname Chidori, a Whispered candidate. He is ordered to join her high school class and be as close to her as possible to prevent her from falling into enemy hands&amp;mdash;that is, if he can safely blend in with their fellow classmates without revealing his true identity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sousuke, who was raised on a battlefield and has very little knowledge of an average high school student&amp;#039;s lifestyle, must adapt to a normal school life to safeguard Kaname. However, enemy forces have already begun making their move, and Sousuke is about to find out that the adversary coming for the Whispered girl may be a lot more familiar than he expects.&lt;br /&gt;

		<synopsis>It's back-to-school mayhem with Kaname Chidori and her war-freak classmate Sousuke Sagara as they encounter more misadventures in and out of Jindai High School. But when Kaname gets into some serious trouble, Sousuke takes the guise of Bonta-kun&amp;mdash;the gun-wielding, butt-kicking mascot. And while he struggles to continue living as a normal teenager, Sousuke also has to deal with protecting his superior officer Teletha Testarossa, who has decided to take a vacation from Mithril and spend a couple of weeks as his and Kaname's classmate.&lt;br /&gt;

		<synopsis>Edward Elric, a young, brilliant alchemist, has lost much in his twelve-year life: when he and his brother Alphonse try to resurrect their dead mother through the forbidden act of human transmutation, Edward loses his brother as well as two of his limbs. With his supreme alchemy skills, Edward binds Alphonse&amp;#039;s soul to a large suit of armor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A year later, Edward, now promoted to the fullmetal alchemist of the state, embarks on a journey with his younger brother to obtain the Philosopher&amp;#039;s Stone. The fabled mythical object is rumored to be capable of amplifying an alchemist&amp;#039;s abilities by leaps and bounds, thus allowing them to override the fundamental law of alchemy: to gain something, an alchemist must sacrifice something of equal value. Edward hopes to draw into the military&amp;#039;s resources to find the fabled stone and restore his and Alphonse&amp;#039;s bodies to normal. However, the Elric brothers soon discover that there is more to the legendary stone than meets the eye, as they are led to the epicenter of a far darker battle than they could have ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;
